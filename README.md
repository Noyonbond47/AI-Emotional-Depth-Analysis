# Case Study: AI-Assisted Exploration of Psychological Depth and Taboo Themes

This repository contains a research project analyzing the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating a nuanced, character-driven psychological drama. The project explores the AI's ability to handle sensitive themes, complex emotional states, and the fallout from a story centered on a social taboo.

The goal was to move beyond simple storytelling and use the AI as a tool to model intricate human emotions like guilt, trauma, and hypocritical jealousy, framed within a slow-burn narrative.

### Key Research Questions Explored:

* Can an LLM navigate the ethical and narrative minefield of a taboo relationship without resorting to generic or romanticized tropes?
* How effectively can AI model and portray the long-term psychological consequences of trauma, such as withdrawal and emotional armoring?
* What level of prompting and human guidance is required to make an AI generate text that reflects complex, contradictory human emotions like guilt-driven jealousy?

### Skills Demonstrated:

* **Psychological Narrative Design:** Crafting a story based on character wounds, coping mechanisms, and complex motivations.
* **AI Capability Analysis:** Testing and documenting an AI's performance on sensitive, nuanced, and emotionally complex subject matter.
* **Ethical Content Exploration:** Using AI as a tool to safely explore the "why" behind social taboos and their dramatic consequences.
* **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Guiding the AI through a slow-burn drama, focusing on subtext and atmosphere over explicit plot.
